# Day 5 — Challenges

This folder currently contains no challenge scripts.

## Notes

- Add your challenge script (for example `day5_challenge.py`) and rerun to generate a README with a description and algorithm.

## Template for challenge sections

When you add a script, include these sections in its README:

1. Challenge Description — brief problem statement.
2. Approach / Logic Used — short explanation of the method.
3. Algorithm / Steps — numbered steps to reproduce the solution.
